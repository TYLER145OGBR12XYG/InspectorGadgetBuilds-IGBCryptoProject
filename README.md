# InspectorGadgetBuilds-IGBCryptoProject
Planning my Roadmap for launching the IGB token on the Ethereum network, specifically for use in your NFT marketplace: (Using AI)

1. **Project Definition:**
   - Define the vision and scope of the NFT marketplace.
   - Establish how the IGB token will integrate with the marketplace.

2. **Technical Specification:**
   - Choose the Ethereum token standard (likely ERC-721 or ERC-1155 for NFTs).
   - Design smart contracts for minting, buying, selling, and trading NFTs.

3. **Smart Contract Development:**
   - Develop smart contracts for the IGB token and NFT transactions.
   - Conduct thorough testing on testnets (e.g., Rinkeby or Ropsten).

4. **Security Measures:**
   - Perform security audits on smart contracts.
   - Implement best practices for smart contract security.

5. **Tokenomics and Utility:**
   - Define the token supply, distribution, and issuance mechanism.
   - Clarify the utility of IGB tokens within the marketplace (e.g., payment, governance).

6. **Legal Framework:**
   - Ensure compliance with KYC/AML regulations.
   - Obtain legal advice to navigate intellectual property rights for NFTs.

7. **Platform Development:**
   - Build the user interface for your NFT marketplace.
   - Integrate wallet services for users to hold and transact with IGB tokens.

8. **Community and Marketing:**
   - Develop a marketing strategy to attract users and creators.
   - Foster a community around your marketplace and token.

9. **Launch Strategy:**
   - Plan a phased launch with beta testing involving community members.
   - Organize events or partnerships to boost initial adoption.

10. **Exchange Listing:**
    - Work towards listing IGB tokens on cryptocurrency exchanges.
    - Consider liquidity pools if you're planning decentralized exchange listings.

11. **Ongoing Development:**
    - Collect user feedback and provide regular updates.
    - Expand features and partnerships to grow the marketplace.

12. **Sustainability:**
    - Implement a revenue model to ensure long-term viability.
    - Consider staking or other mechanisms to incentivize holding IGB tokens.

What the token will do, everytime someone buys from the store, they will be rewarded with an incentive, for every transaction made on the store-chain, the user will be rewarded a small percentage of their transaction fee paid back to them in the form of IGB token, 3.5% of the users spend on igbonline.xyz, must reward the user into his/her wallet onlinewallet. The transaction fee, is then split 50/50, between the developer and the owner of the store. The token must then also e able to integrate onto the  Ethereum blockchain, for a rewards contract deployment. The code will look something like this:

// IGBToken contract
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract IGBToken {
    string public name = "IGB Token";
    string public symbol = "IGB";
    uint8 public decimals = 18;
    uint256 public totalSupply;

    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowance;

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);

    constructor(uint256 _initialSupply) {
        totalSupply = _initialSupply * 10**uint256(decimals);
        balanceOf[msg.sender] = totalSupply;
    }

    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
        require(_to != address(0), "Invalid address");
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value, "Insufficient balance");

        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;
        balanceOf[_to] += _value;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
        return true;
    }

    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
        require(_spender != address(0), "Invalid address");
        allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
        return true;
    }

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
        require(_from != address(0), "Invalid address");
        require(_to != address(0), "Invalid address");
        require(balanceOf[_from] >= _value, "Insufficient balance");
        require(allowance[_from][msg.sender] >= _value, "Allowance exceeded");

        balanceOf[_from] -= _value;
        balanceOf[_to] += _value;
        allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
        emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
        return true;
    }
}

For the security token:

// IGBToken contract with Web3 and security principles
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract IGBToken is ERC20, Ownable {
    constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20("IGB Token", "IGB") {
        _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply *50,000,000.00**decimals());
    }

    // Mint additional tokens (only owner can call this)
    function mint(uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        _mint(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    // Burn tokens (only owner can call this)
    function burn(uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}

This one will integrate with the Solana chain, as the project is still in development phase. The initial supply will be at least 10-50million tokens to be generate and every 5 years 50 000 tokens will be burnt. Until the wallets who hold the wallet and the available supply is completely gone. The plan is to sell as many tokens as possible. In the wallet test and airdrop phase, early-bird users or those who sign up for the test wallet and airdrop phase will only receive 5000 tokens. Only 500 users will be able to enter the test drop and the airdrop will distribute 2.5 million tokens at the 500users=5000tokens drop phase. This will enable the first holders of the wallet to have the early-bird token, and will have 2.5 million coins available in wallets. If the total supply is for eg.50million, the early bird users counted all together, will be 2500000. Calculations make it.

50 000 000 total supply.
early bird users - 2 500 000
burning every 5 years, 50 000

50 000 000 IGB tokens - 2 500 000 test wallet users = 47 500 000 initial supply after test phase.
After ICO, IPO and crowdfunding phase, the total number of tokens, will be halved, meaning that 23 750 000 will be for the store chain, and the other half will be made available for the different exchanges.

IGBRC will be the coin, and will have its own, block network(this will integrate with the Solana chain).

For eg, 23 750 000 will be only available for trade on the igbonline.xyz store-chain. The store price will stay a fixed $5 = R94.80. Which will give users the opportunity to buy the coin at a lower price. The exchange price, the store price and the IGBRC coin price, will be very different, and the other 23 750 000, will then be distributed across the different Ethereum networks, for sale on the exchange platforms. This coin, will then be made variable, meaning that if it starts trade at $5/pc, the price will either go-up or down, as any other coin. The exchange and the store price, will be the same across the network, and all coin prices must match, otherwise the exchange that sells the coin for more than its 5% markup, will then be disqualified from selling the coin. Every exchange has different markup values, and this must also be taken into consideration, but IGB would love to have a low 5% markup across all exchanges. 

The Solana IGBRC token supply, will be a very rare token, and will be named IGBRC(Inspector Gadget Builds RARE Coin). For only 50 000 will be created for this chain. The Solana wallet chain, will stay at a fixed price of $50 per coin and will not go up or down in value, rather, the coin can be held in your Solana wallet, for staking purposes to be rewarded with Sol, which will also, help increase the inclusivity and value of the Solana coin itself. You also will not be able to mine or mint this coin. The coin will be made so that it gives you and incentive of Sol rewards, at 0.125% per 50coins held over a period of 24hours. Meaning that if you hold 50 IGBRC, you will be rewarded. 50*0.125%(Solcoin) at the value of Solana, meaning, if you are rewarded 0.125 IGBRC coins per 24 hours (at the value of Solana). So if Solana is $140p/sol. The reward will be generated on this principle. 50 IGBRC*0.25%(Exchange to the value of Solana)=Reward/Incentive, so the amount of IGBRC generated every 24hours, is 0.125 For evry 50 IGBRC coins held, which rewards you the value of Sol(So if IGBRC is $50 dollars) The value of its exchange price to Sol, will be rewarded in Solana coin. meaning. (0.125 IGBRC, price is $0.125)it will be exchanged to SOL automatically to give you the reward in Sol. So the More IGBRC coins you hold, the higher your reward/incentive. So if you hold 100 IGBRC coins, the reward is 0.25, etc. Remember, the reward price stays 0.125% for every 50 coins held, so if you hold 100, the coin incentive percentage increases to 0.25, if you have 150, the reward becomes 0.375%, if you hold 200, the reward becomes 0,5% and so the percentage goes up the more you hold, this is per 24hours. 

Regarding IGB Token:
The instore wallet, will also have a timer for you to check when the date when the coin will be burnt, and only holders of the coin will be able to access this feature. If you do not hold the IGB token on the instore wallet you will not be able to access or see these features. 

The token, available on the store-chain, will not burn tokens, across the other exchanges, tokens will be burnt until the holder supply and the initial supply matches, meaning that if their are 15m users holding, then the initial supply will burn until only 20m tokens are available. 
This would increase the rarity of the coin bring the total volume of the coin available down to a minimum, meaning that once the coin runs out of initial supply available for buying purposes the coin will be delisted on exchanges, and will only be available instore.
